# integral_table_electrodynamics

This is a table of integrals commonly encountered in an undergraduate electrodynamics course.

I use it as a supplementary handout at the beginning of the course and provide a copy during exams.

In particular, it includes integrals encountered in Introduction to Electrodymaics by David Griffiths.
